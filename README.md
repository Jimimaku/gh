![gh](http://owenou.com/gh/images/gangnamtocat.png)

Fast GitHub command line client implemented in Go. Since [v2.2.0](https://github.com/github/hub/releases/tag/v2.2.0), [`gh` has been merged into `hub`](https://github.com/github/hub/issues/475). Future development will happen in [github/hub](https://github.com/github/hub). [Mislav](https://github.com/mislav) from GitHub has written a blog [post](https://mislav.net/2020/01/github-cli/) about this project's progression.

Thank you for the support.
